# Elopher

Elopher aims to provide a full-featured gopher client for GNU Emacs.
It currently supports:
- simple keyboard and mouse-driven browsing,
- caching of visited sites,
- clean and configurable visualization of Gopher directories,
- direct visualisation of image files.

Much of Elopher is still under development.  Planned features include:
- support for gopher search engines,
- optional in-line rendering of image links in directories.

Keep the non-web internet alive!
