# Elopher

Elopher aims to provide a full-featured gopher client for GNU Emacs.
It currently supports:
- simple keyboard and mouse-driven browsing,
- caching of visited sites,
- clean and configurable visualization of Gopher directories,
- direct visualisation of image files,
- clickable web and gopher links in plain text.

Much of Elopher is still under development.  Planned features include:
- better use of standard faces for better compatibility with different
  colour schemes,
- support for multiple Elopher buffers.

Keep the non-web internet alive!
