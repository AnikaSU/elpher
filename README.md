# Elpher

Elpher aims to provide a full-featured gopher client for GNU Emacs.
It supports:
- simple keyboard and mouse-driven browsing,
- caching of visited sites,
- clean and configurable visualization of Gopher directories,
- direct visualisation of image files,
- clickable web and gopher links in plain text.

Elpher is still under development.  Planned features include:
- (m)enu key support, similar to the emacs info browser,
- support for multiple Elpher buffers.

Keep the non-web internet alive!
